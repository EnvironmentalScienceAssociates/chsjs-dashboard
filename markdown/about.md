Welcome to the Clearwater Harbor & St. Joseph Sound (CHSJS) water quality dashboard. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide working updates on data collection for the CHSJS Nutrient Source Tracking Project. The dashboard contains pages on all sampling elements that have generated data to date. NOTE: The dashboard is currently in development phase and is meant for internal communication amongst stakeholders and not for public use. Contents should not be considered final or used without permission

### Water Quality

The Water Quality page contains the routine water quality data collected by Pinellas County in CHSJS as well as additional sites collected by Environmental Sciences Associates (ESA) for the study. The subpanels provide different ways of looking at the data for a specific parameter or site as well as interactivity by hovering the cursor to show the data values or site names.

### Isotopes

The Isotopes page contains an  interactive scatter plot of Delta 18O and Delta 15N for sites where nitrate concentraions were > 0.06 mg/l. the plots illustrate potential sources of nitrogen using bounding boxes as described in ([Canion et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.2113/EEG-2310)).

### Rainfall

The Rainfall page contains a map of annual rainful sums based on daily NEXRAD data avalable from the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD). Currently, there are some issues with the 2004 data due to problems with that year's radar and so 2024 is not displayed.

### Seagrass

The Seagrass page contains an annual time series plot for the selected parameter (i.e., percent cover, blade length, or algae) by strata to track changes in seagrass condition over time. This page is in its infancy. 

### Groundwater

Surficial groundwater samples (~6 feet deep) are being collected to identify potential sub surface nitration pathways. This page displays the lcoation of samples and results of sampling to date. 

### Tracers

Special nutrient and bacterial source tracking samples have been collected based on reconnaissance efforts to pinpoint potential areas of anthropogenic nutrient pollution within the watershed. This page displays the lcoation of samples and results of sampling to date.

### Tropical System Sampling

Special sampling was conducted associated with Hurricane Debby in June 2024. The results of that sampling effort is provided on this page.
