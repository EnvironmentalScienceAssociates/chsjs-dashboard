Welcome to the Clearwater Harbor & St. Joseph Sound data dashboard. The purpose of this web app is to provide updates on data collection for the CHSJS Nutrient Source Tracking Project. The app contains pages on all sampling elements that have generated data to date. NOTE: It is still under construction. 

### Water Quality

The Water Quality page contains the routine water quality data and the ESA extra sites for the 2024 monitoring activities. The tabs provide different ways of looking at the data for a specific parameter or site as well as the interactivity showing the data values or site locations (maps).

### Isotopes 

The Isotopes page contains a single interactive scatter plot of Delta 18O and Delta 15N annotated with bounding boxes showing potential sources of nitrate ([Canion et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.2113/EEG-2310)).

### Rainfall

The Rainfall page contains a map of annual rainful based on daily NEXRAD data avalable from SWFWMD. There are known issues with 2004 data due to problems with that year's radar.

### Seagrass

The Seagrass page contains an annual time series plot for the selected parameter (i.e., cover, blade length, or depth) by strata. 

### Groundwater
